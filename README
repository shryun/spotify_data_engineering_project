## Overview  
The goal of this project is to design a unified data platform that ingests Spotify data, stores it in a single Iceberg table format on AWS S3, and makes it queryable with AWS services, providing ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel with Apache Iceberg

## Tech Stack
- **AWS Lambda** – Serverless batch data ingestion  
- **Amazon S3 + Apache Iceberg** – Unified, scalable data lake storage  
- **Amazon Athena** – Interactive ad-hoc SQL queries  
- **AWS Glue** – Data cataloging and ETL orchestration
